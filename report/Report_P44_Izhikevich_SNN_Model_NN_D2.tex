\title{Simulating the Izhikevich spiking neuron model using
the Brian2 software}

\author{Julen Etxaniz and Ibon Urbina}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

% Copied from project description to show references

The study of spike-timing dynamics in the brain is of interest to neuroscientists and the artificial
network community. Investigation of the relative timing of spikes of multiple neurons \cite{Izhikevich2008LargescaleMO} and the
role they play in temporal coding in the brain is an important issue issue. Similarly, spiking networks
can serve as powerful supervised learning and memory representation tools with several potential
applications in the machine learning domain \cite{PaugamMoisy2008DelayLA}.

The Izhikevich spiking neuron model \cite{Izhikevich2003Simple} \cite{Izhikevich2004Which} is a two-dimensional system of ordinary differential
equations.

The goal of the project is to implement the Izhikevichâ€™s model using the Brian2 Python library \url{https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/}.
