Run the cell below by clicking on it and hitting `CTRL+ENTER`. You can change the parameters of the model with the sliders, and immediately see the change in behaviour.\n","\n","The model is a group of $N$ source neurons that fire Poisson spikes with a rate $R_\\mathrm{max}(1+\\sin(2\\pi f t))/2$, connected via synapses to a target neuron. Each source neuron has a probability $p$ of being connected, and synapses have a certain fixed weight $w$. The target neuron has two variables, the membrane potential $V$ and the adaptation potential $V_t$ that evolve according to the differential equations:\n","\n","$$\\tau\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{dt}}=-V$$\n","\n","$$\\tau_t\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_t}{\\mathrm{dt}}=1-V_t$$\n","\n","Each time the event $V>V_t$ occurs, the neuron spikes and $V$ is reset to 0, while $V_t$ increases by $\\delta_t$.\n","\n","This model is implemented with the following code:\n","\n","```python\n","G = PoissonGroup(N, rates='R_max*0.5*(1+sin(2*pi*f*t))')\n","eqs = '''\n","dV/dt = -V/tau : 1\n","dVt/dt = (1-Vt)/tau_t : 1\n","'''\n","H = NeuronGroup(1, eqs, threshold='V>Vt', reset='V=0; Vt += delta_t', method='linear')\n","H.Vt = 1\n","S = Synapses(G, H, on_pre='V += w')\n","S.connect(p=p)\n","```"]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["%matplotlib inline\n","from brian2 import *\n","from brian2tools import *\n","import ipywidgets as ipw\n","prefs.codegen.target = 'numpy'\n","\n","def model(N=20, R_max=150, f=10, w=0.1, p=0.5, tau=5, tau_t=50, delta_t=0.1):\n","    # Get parameters\n","    R_max = R_max*Hz\n","    f = f*Hz\n","    tau = tau*ms\n","    tau_t = tau_t*ms\n","    duration = 200*ms\n","    \n","    # Simulation code\n","    G = PoissonGroup(N, rates='R_max*0.5*(1+sin(2*pi*f*t))')\n","    eqs = '''\n","    dV/dt = -V/tau : 1\n","    dVt/dt = (1-Vt)/tau_t : 1\n","    '''\n","    H = NeuronGroup(1, eqs, threshold='V>Vt', reset='V=0; Vt += delta_t', method='linear')\n","    H.Vt = 1\n","    S = Synapses(G, H, on_pre='V += w')\n","    S.connect(p=p)\n","    # Run it\n","    MG = SpikeMonitor(G)\n","    MH = StateMonitor(H, ('V', 'Vt'), record=True)\n","    run(duration)\n","    \n","    # Plotting code\n","    figure(figsize=(15, 4))\n","    subplot(131)\n","    brian_plot(MG)\n","    title('Source neurons (Poisson)')\n","    subplot(132)\n","    plot(zeros(N), arange(N), 'ob')\n","    plot([0, 1], [S.i, ones(len(S.i))*N/2.], '-k')\n","    plot([1], [N/2.], 'og')\n","    xlim(-0.1, 1.1)\n","    ylim(-1, N)\n","    axis('off')\n","    title('Synapses')\n","    subplot(133)\n","    plot(MH.t, MH.V[0], label='V')\n","    plot(MH.t, MH.Vt[0], label='Vt')\n","    legend(loc='upper left')\n","    title('Target neuron')\n","    \n","layout = ipw.Layout(width='100%')\n","style = {'description_width': 'initial'}\n","ipw.interact(model,\n","             N=ipw.IntSlider(value=20, min=5, max=100, step=5, continuous_update=False,\n","                             description=\"Number of source neurons\", style=style, layout=layout),\n","             R_max=ipw.FloatSlider(value=300, min=0, max=500, step=10, continuous_update=False,\n","                                   description=r\"Source neuron max firing rate (Hz)\", style=style, layout=layout),\n","             f=ipw.FloatSlider(value=10, min=1, max=50, step=1, continuous_update=False,\n","                               description=r\"Source neuron frequency (Hz)\", style=style, layout=layout),\n","             p=ipw.FloatSlider(value=0.5, min=0, max=1, step=0.01, continuous_update=False,\n","                               description=r\"Synapse probability\", style=style, layout=layout),\n","             w=ipw.FloatSlider(value=0.3, min=0, max=1, step=0.01, continuous_update=False,\n","                               description=r\"Synapse weight\", style=style, layout=layout),\n","             tau=ipw.FloatSlider(value=5, min=1, max=50, step=1, continuous_update=False,\n","                                 description=r\"Target neuron membrane time constant (ms)\", style=style, layout=layout),\n","             tau_t=ipw.FloatSlider(value=30, min=5, max=500, step=5, continuous_update=False,\n","                                   description=r\"Target neuron adaptation constant (ms)\", style=style, layout=layout),\n","             delta_t=ipw.FloatSlider(value=1.0, min=0, max=20, step=0.1, continuous_update=False,\n","                                     description=r\"Target neuron adaptation strength\", style=style, layout=layout),\n","            );"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.11","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
